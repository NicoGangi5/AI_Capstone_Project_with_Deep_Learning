# AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning

By IBM on Coursera

###About this Course

In this capstone, learners will apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge.  They will use a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners  will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.
